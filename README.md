# Dockeriot

Dockeriot is an apps development platform for IOT devices using docker.
Dockeriot aims to enable all the features of containers for applications
under an Internet of things (IOT - cloud enabled) environment. If you want to see further and rapid developments on dockeriot please support us via  [Contact](CONTACT.md) or [Funding](.github/FUNDING.md)

Applications of dockeriot include: 
* Testing and deploying of complex applications on many devices in a replicable and scalable way. 
* Fast integration of new features in a chain of devices allowing testing deploying and integration.
* Fast integration with distributed technologies like blockchain and other DLTs.

```Note: Although here we depict a general platform, the first layer that is developed is the:``` [Things Layer](ThingsLayer.md)

## General scheme

* The things and green layer can be implemented with other embedded platforms different than raspberry
* Apps developed on the things layer can only use docker. 

* For more information on layers you can see: [Things Layer](ThingsLayer.md), [Industrial Layer](IndustrialLayer.md), [Analytics Layer](AnalyticsLayer.md), Green layer.
